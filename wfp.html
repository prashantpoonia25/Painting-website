    <p> Artist: <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> <br>
        Estimated date: <b>1503 to 1519</b> <br>
        Where to see it: <b>Louvre Museum (Paris)</b>
    </p>
    
    <div class="container"><p> The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal
        masterpiece of
        the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written
        about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world". The painting's novel qualities
        include the subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of
        forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.

        The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and
        is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506;
        however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by King Francis I of France
        and is now the property of the French Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre, Paris since 1797.

    <p> Artist: <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> <br>
        Estimated date: <b>1495 to 1498</b> <br>
        Where to see it: <b>Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan, Italy)</b>
    </p>
    <div class="container"><p>The Last Supper is a late 15th-century mural painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci housed by the refectory
        of the Convent
        of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It is one of the Western world's most recognizable paintings.

        The work is assumed to have been started around 1495–96 and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to
        the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The painting
        represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with his apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John, 13:21.
        Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Apostles when Jesus announced that one of
        them would betray him.<i><b>Click on the above image to know more about the painting.</b></i>

        Where to see it: <b>Museo del Prado (Madrid)</b>
    </p>
    <div class="container"><p>Las Meninas is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the
        Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and
        creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities,
        Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting.

        "Golden Period". It was exhibited in 1908 under the title Liebespaar (the lovers) as stated in the catalogue of
        the exhibition. The painting depicts a couple embracing each other, their bodies entwined in elaborate beautiful
        robes decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier
        Arts and Crafts movement. The painting now hangs in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the
        Belvedere, Vienna, and is considered a masterpiece of Vienna Secession (local variation of Art Nouveau) and
        Klimt's most popular work.<i><b>Click on the above image to know more about the painting.</b></i>
