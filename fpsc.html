            Famous Paintings of Some Countries</h1>
    </span>
    <h3>1.France</h3>
    <span><img src="France.png" alt="France" width="500px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>Although an aristocrat by birth, Toulouse-Lautrec’s work captures the grit and glamour of working-class nightlife
        in Belle Époque Paris. Local performers and personalities inhabit his canvases, underscoring the artist’s
        inimitable brand of post-impressionist realism. Here, “Valentine the Boneless,” a Moulin Rouge veteran,
        instructs a new dancer in the art of the can-can.</p></div>
    <h3>2.Mexico</h3>
    <span><img src="Mexico.png" alt="Mexico" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>Frida Kahlo produced 55 self-portraits during her prolific career, merging a personal iconography of pain and
        loss with potent symbols of her Mexican heritage. “Self Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird” depicts
        Kahlo in a lush jungle wearing a necklace made of thorns. The artistic process served as a cathartic outlet for
        Kahlo’s traumatic split from fellow artist Diego Rivera.
    </p></div>
    <h3>3.Japan</h3>
    <span><img src="Japan.png" alt="Japan" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>One of the most celebrated works in Japanese art, “The Great Wave off Kanagawa” is part of a series of block
        prints known as the “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji.” Hokusai began his career at the tender age of 6, and
        is
        believed to have been in his 70s when he created his masterpiece.
    </p></div>
    <h3>4.Netherlands</h3>
    <span><img src="Netherlands.webp" alt="Netherlands" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>It’s estimated that a staggering 5 million paintings were produced in the Netherlands during the 17th
        century, a
        period dubbed by art historians as the Dutch Golden Age. No work represents this era more ambitiously
        than Jan
        Vermeer’s “The Art of Painting.” The image depicts the painter, his back to the viewer, capturing the
        likeness
        of a comely model posing as Clio, the muse of history.
    </p></div>
    <h3>5.England</h3>
    <span><img src="England.png" alt="England" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a 19th-century English aesthetic movement, were drawn to religious
        and literary
        subjects painted in a highly realistic manner. Waterhouse’s “The Lady of Shalott” illustrates a
        verse from
        Tennyson’s 1832 poem based on a medieval Arthurian legend. The landscape was painted by the artist
        en plein air
        in the English countryside.
    </p></div>
    <h3>6.Sweden</h3>
    <span><img src="Sweden.webp" alt="Sweden" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>Dubbed the Norman Rockwell of Sweden, Carl Larsson is famous for his warm-hearted representations
        of middle-class
        Swedes engaged in work and play. This watercolor depicts Larsson’s wife walking pensively along
        the banks of the
        Sundborn River. The couple’s daughter, Brita, dressed in local costume, occupies the rowboat to
        the right of the
        scene, together with the family dog.
    </p></div>
    <h3>7.Spain</h3>
    <span><img src="Spain.webp" alt="Spain" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>Few paintings pack the political or emotional punch of “Guernica”—an anguished testament to
        the Nazi bombing of
        the eponymous Basque town at the request of Spanish Nationalists. Commissioned by the
        Spanish Republican
        Government for the 1937 Paris World’s Fair, the monumental canvas brought the atrocities of
        the Spanish Civil
        War to international attention.
    </p></div>
    <h3>8.Czech Republic</h3>
    <span><img src="Czech Republic.webp" alt="Czech Republic" width="500px" class="nature"></a></span>
    <div class="container"><p>Art Nouveau legend Alphonse Mucha was born in Moravia but spent his early career in Paris
        creating celebrated art
        posters. In 1910 he returned to what is now the Czech Republic for the express purpose
        of painting 20 monumental
        canvases celebrating the history and folklore of the Slavic people. His monumental work
        was finished in 1928 and
        presented by the artist to the city of Prague.</p></div>
    <h3>9.India</h3>
    <span><img src="India.webp" alt="India" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>This iconic image of the Bodhisattva Padmapani (an incarnation embodying the compassion
        of all Buddhas) is part
        of an elaborate series of paintings covering the walls of a cave complex in Maharashtra.
        A former Buddish
        monastery, the Ajanta Caves are now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
    </p></div>
    <h3>10.Belarus</h3>
    <span><img src="Belarus.webp" alt="Belarus" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>Born Moishe Shagal, modernist Marc Chagall received his artistic training in Paris and
        St. Petersburg, yet never
        forgot his roots on a Belarussian shtetl. “I and the Village,” a mesmerizing evocation
        of Chagall’s homeland,
        employs the artist’s trademark primary hued palette.
    </p></div>
    <h3>11.Norway</h3>
    <span><img src="Norway.webp" alt="Norway" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>Popularly known as “The Scream,” Munch’s surrealist icon was originally titled “The
        Shriek of Nature” and was
        inspired by a disturbing vision the artist experienced while walking in the Norwegian
        countryside. Munch
        executed several versions of “The Scream,” two of which were stolen and subsequently
        recovered.
    </p></div>
    <h3>12.Germany</h3>
    <span><img src="Germany.webp" alt="Germany" width="500px" class="nature">
    </span>
    <div class="container"><p>A titan of German Romanticism, Caspar David Friedrich specialized in allegorical
        landscapes populated by pensive
        youths. “Two Men Contemplating the Moon” is a joint portrait of the artist and his
        friend and disciple, August
        Heinrich. Friedrich painted the scene three times, twice during Heinrich’s lifetime, and
        later this work,
        executed after his death in 1824.</p></div>
