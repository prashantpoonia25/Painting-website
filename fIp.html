            Famous Indian Paintings</h1>
    </span>
    <h3>1. Self Portrait – Amrita Sher-Gil</h3>
    <span><img src="Self Portrait-Amrita Sher-Gil.jpg" alt="Self Portrait – Amrita Sher-Gil" width="300px"
            class="nature"></span>
            <div class="container"><p>This is a 1931 self-portrait by Amrita Sher-Gil, depicting one of India’s most important modern
        artists at the
        age of 18. This is the also first painting by the artist ever to be offered in Christie’s London, and one of
        only eight canvases by Sher-Gil to be offered at auction globally. Sher-Gil’s self-portraits are painted with an
        intensity that is almost hypnotic, drawing the viewer into the innermost psyche of the artist, where one
        discovers a sea of melancholy.</p></div>
    <h3>2. Bharat Mata – Abanindranath Tagore</h3>
    <span><img src="Bharat Mata.jpg" alt="Bharat Mata – Abanindranath Tagore" width="300px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>One of the most iconic paintings of Abanindranath Tagore (the founder of the Bengal School of Art), Bharat Mata
        depicts a saffron clad woman, dressed like a sadhvi, holding a book, sheaves of paddy, a piece of white cloth
        and a garland in her four hands. Immensely important because of its emotional and historical value, the painting
        became immensely popular among the nationalists in those days, especially in the wake of Lord Curzon’s plan to
        bifurcate Bengal. Interestingly, Sister Nivedita, an admirer of the painting, wanted to carry it from Kashmir to
        Kanyakumari to spread nationalist fervour among the people of the country
    </p></div>
    <h3>3. Shakuntala – Raja Ravi Verma</h3>
    <span><img src="Shakuntala.jpg" alt="Shakuntala – Raja Ravi Verma" width="300px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>Shakuntala is an epic painting by celebrated Indian painter, Raja Ravi Varma. Ravi Varma, depicts Shakuntala, an
        important character of Mahabaratha, pretending to remove a thorn from her foot, while actually looking for her
        husband/lover, Dushyantha, while her friends call her bluff.</p></div>
    <h3>4. Bapuji – Nandlal Bose</h3></div>
    <span><img src="gandhi-march-bapuji-1930.jpg" alt="Bapuji – Nandlal Bose" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>Everybody knows about Mahatma Gandhi as one of the greatest freedom fighters the world has ever seen. But how
        many among us know that Bapu has been a muse for many of his contemporary artists both in India and abroad? The
        legendary Nandalal Bose, an artist of Shantiniketan during the life time of Gandhi, had stated that Bapu was an
        inspiration for all artists. His famous linocut portrait of the Mahatma titled ‘Dandi March’ (with the legend
        Bapuji, 1930, inscribed on it) created in 1930, reflects his respect for Gandhi and is on permanent display at
        the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi.</p></div>
    <h3>5. Mahishasura – Tyeb Mehta</h3>
    <span><img src="Mahishasura.jpg" alt="Mahishasura – Tyeb Mehta" width="300px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>The most important work by India’s finest contemporary artist, Tyeb Mehta’s Mahishasura – a reinterpretation of
        the tale of the demon by the same name – was the first Indian painting to cross the million dollar mark, selling
        for a whopping $1.584 million at Christie’s in 2005. The painting happened after Tyeb’s visit to Shantiniketan
        where he was inspired by the legend of Mahishasura. Mehta fuses ancient imagery with simplicity of form, colour
        and line, resulting in a powerfully modern work full of fresh vitality.</p></div>
    <h3>6. Self-Portrait – Rabindranath Tagore
    </h3>
    <span><img src="Self-Portrait – Rabindranath Tagore.jpg" alt="Self-Portrait – Rabindranath Tagore" width="300px"
            class="nature"></span>
        <div class="container"><p>Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore started painting in 1924 at the age of 63, though long before this, an element
        of effort could be noticed in the various corrections and doodles in his manuscripts. Towards the end of his
        career, Tagore, striving to create a universally accessible art, took up painting more consistently. He made
        thousands of sketches and drawings using brush, pencil and pen, the most famous of them being his self-portrait.
        This painting depicts the full-face, self-portrait of the bearded artist, enhanced by the lack of colour,
        unworked background and the use of primitive looking pencil lines.</p></div>
    <h3>7. Three Pujarins – Jamini Roy
    </h3>
    <span><img src="Three Pujarins.jpg" alt="Three Pujarins – Jamini Roy" width="300px" height="400px"
            class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>Jamini Roy, the eminent Bengali artist who is counted among the early modernists of twentieth century Indian art,
        created a masterpiece when he painted three almond-eyed priestesses for his work named Three Pujarins. Inspired
        by the folk art tradition of Bengal, Roy experimented with vibrant colours and developed his own individual
        style of painting that resulted in artwork that were a visual feast.</p></div>
    <h3>8. Horses – M F Husain</h3>
    <span><img src="Horses.jpg" alt="Horses – M F Husain" width="400px" height="300px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>Early in his painting career, and until his death, Maqbool Fida Husain, one of India’s most prolific painters,
        enjoyed depicting the lively and free spirit of horses in many of his works. This painting by the maestro
        captures the power and energy of three horses through bold outlines that define the strong beasts in full
        gallop. Among Husain’s best works and a collector’s dream, this painting was placed on auction at Christie’s in
        2008 and fetched over INR 1 crore.</p></div>
    <div><h3>9. Krishna (Spring in Kullu) – Nicholas Roerich</h3>
    <span><img src="Krishna.jpg" alt="Krishna (Spring in Kullu) – Nicholas Roerich" width="600px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>One cannot overlook the claim of Krishna (Spring in Kullu) by famous Russian artist Nicholas Roerich while
        talking about famous Indian art work. The painting that is on permanent display at Nicholas Roerich Museum, New
        York has Krishna playing the flute under a tree in blossom with majestic snow covered mountains in the backdrop.
        Roerich, who after having traveled the world, made Kullu his home and died there. In 1979, he was declared by
        ASI as one of the nine artists whose work are considered national art treasures.</p></div>
    <h3>10. Bindu – S H Raza</h3>
    <span><img src="Bindu.jpg" alt="Bindu – S H Raza" width="400px" class="nature"></span>
    <div class="container"><p>A legendary modern artist who popularised Indian iconography globally, Syed Haider Raza never tired of the
        bindu‘or the shunya that became the focal point of energy in his work. Through his long and prolific career —
        his first solo exhibition was in the year 1946 — Raza’s art evolved continuously. But by the ’70s, he had found
        the motif that would make him a legend: the bindu. Raza once stated that “Bindu is a source of energy, source of
        life. Life begins here, attains infinity here.” Other than the bindu, his instantly recognizable trademark
        geometric abstract works also explored themes like prakriti (nature), kundalini (primal energy) and tribhuj
        (triangle)</p></div>
